# E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction - GitHub Repository Structure

A machine learning project to predict whether e-commerce products will be delivered on time based on various operational and customer factors.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze e-commerce delivery data and predict delivery performance. By identifying key factors that lead to late deliveries, businesses can proactively manage their logistics operations and improve customer satisfaction.

### Key Features
- üîç Comprehensive EDA of delivery patterns
- üõ†Ô∏è Advanced feature engineering
- ü§ñ Multiple ML model comparison
- üìä Business impact analysis
- üöÄ Production-ready code structure

## üìà Results Summary

- **Best Model**: Decision Tree
- **Accuracy**: 64.09%
- **Precision**: 69.89%
- **Recall**: 69.99%
- **F1-Score**: 69.94%
- **ROC-AUC**: 62.67%

üìä Data Description
The dataset contains 10,999 e-commerce delivery records with the following features:
üîß Feature Engineering
Key engineered features:

Customer experience score
Value density (cost/weight ratio)
High-value order indicators
Customer loyalty metrics
Product weight categories

üìà Model Performance
üí° Key Insights

Customer care calls are the strongest predictor of late deliveries
Orders with 5+ customer care calls have 75%+ chance of being late
Product weight significantly impacts delivery performance
Low importance products have higher late delivery rates
Specific warehouse blocks show performance variations

üéØ Business Recommendations

Immediate Actions:

Flag orders with 4+ customer care calls for priority handling
Implement weight-based routing for heavy products (>5000 gms)
Optimize warehouse-specific processes


Long-term Strategies:

Deploy real-time delivery risk scoring
Integrate ML predictions into order management
Develop dynamic pricing for guaranteed delivery



üîÆ Future Enhancements

 Real-time prediction API
 Dashboard for operations team
 Integration with logistics systems
 Mobile app for delivery personnel
 A/B testing framework
